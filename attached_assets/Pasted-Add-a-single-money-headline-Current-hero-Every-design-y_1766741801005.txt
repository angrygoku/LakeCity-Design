Add a single “money” headline
Current hero: “Every design you can imagine”
Problem: it’s about you, not the outcome they pay for.
Replace with:
“We design wedding suites & pitch decks that get you compliments and capital—delivered in 5 days.”
Now the buyer instantly knows:
What (wedding / pitch)
Benefit (compliments / capital)
Speed (5 days)
Turn the three big service boxes into outcome-driven packages
Instead of “Wedding Designs” call it:
“All-in Wedding Suite – 12 pieces, print-ready, guest-ready in 7 days – ₹18 000”
Do the same for:
“Investor Pitch Deck – 12 slides that close seed rounds – 3-day rush available – ₹25 000”
“Event Printables Bundle – signage to table cards, one invoice – ₹12 000”
Fixed scope + fixed price = faster “yes”.
Insert a 35-word social-proof strip right under the hero
Even if you’ve only done pro-bono work, you have testimonials.
Example:
“Lakecity turned our 40-slide mess into a ₹1.2 Cr seed round in 10 days. Investors said it was the best deck they’d seen.” – Aakriti, Founder, GreenLoop (logo)
One strip, 3 rotators, auto-scroll every 4 s.
Add a “How it works” 3-step graphic
5-min brief form
Get 2 concepts in 24 h
Receive print-ready files + source link
This kills the biggest objection: “I don’t have time to go back and forth.”
Put two big buttons above the fold
Left: “Book a 15-min call” (Calendly)
Right: “WhatsApp us” (mobile-first India audience)
Colour them contrasting but on-brand; track clicks in GA4.
SEO micro-copy under each package
30-word paragraph with the exact keyword you want:
“Affordable wedding invitation designers in Udaipur” – Google picks this up and you start ranking for local searches without a blog.
Capture exit traffic
Add a 5-second delay pop-up:
“Leaving? Get our free 7-slide pitch-deck template (Canva ready).”
Deliver via auto-email; now you have a warm list even if they don’t buy today.
Speed & accessibility quick wins
WebP images, <150 KB each.
Add alt text: “Lakecity Designs – pastel wedding invitation suite” – helps Google Images traffic.
Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio; your mint-green on white fails WCAG. Darken text to #00796B.
Pricing page psychology
If you want to keep “custom” pricing, at least show three anchors:
“Basic ₹12 k, Standard ₹22 k, Premium ₹35 k”
Then a CTA: “Need something else? Ask for a quote.”
Anchors reduce sticker-shock emails by ~40 %.
Footer trust badges
WhatsApp green badge “Reply in <1 h”
“100 % satisfaction or we redo it free”
Secure payment icons (Razorpay, Stripe)
These add last-second credibility before they scroll back up to call.
Copy-paste headline swap (ready to use)
